    <h2>Web Content Developer</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>My interest in web technology stems from classes in high school, when I discovered I could publish my writing on websites only I could see. I'm less shy sharing my work now, but I still love experimenting with new elements of design and function, and seeing how they can interact with content. </p>
        <p>My Content Development certificate is not an afterthought to my English degree, but an integral part of it. I always prefer to design with a content-first approach, and take particular interest in universal design strategies to include multiple devices and all abilities. Check out samples of my academic and professional work below, as well as my web resume. </p>

    <h2>Sample Work</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <a href="https://yorktown.cbe.wwu.edu/students/191/carrolr8/ruthiecarroll/index.html" target="_blank">Personal Portfolio - this site</a>
        <p>I designed and developed this portfolio website in fall 2018 for the final project of my Dynamic Web Pages course. The design incorporates the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> component library, JavaScript, and a JQuery library for the smooth-scroll functionality. </p>
        <a href="https://github.com/ruemca/the-poetic-bloc" target="_blank">the poetic bloc (GitHub Project)</a>
        <p>This is an independent project I completed for my Internship in Internet Studies course during winter 2020, under the advisement of Dr Dustin O'Hara. A detailed description and link to the final demo site are available in the README.md file at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <a href="http://myweb.students.wwu.edu/~carrolr8/eng302/possom/index.html" target="_blank">Palm Oil Sustainability Student Outreach Movement</a>
        <p>I designed and developed this site as part of a group project for my Introduction to Technical and Professional Writing course in spring 2019. The content includes contributions from two other group members, and the function uses the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> library. </p>
        <a href="http://myweb.students.wwu.edu/~carrolr8/wwu/ritadaniels/index.html" target="_blank">Dr Rita Daniels</a>
        <p>Using the template I designed for Dr Salazar, I'm in the process of creating another faculty website for Dr Rita Daniels. The only issues remaining are missing content in a few places, and minor design tweaks to comply with the new branding standards introduced this year from University Communications and Marketing. </p>
        <a href="https://www.wwu.edu/faculty/salazar/" target="_blank">Dr Debra Salazar</a>
        <p>I designed and developed this site as an extracurricular project for Dr Debra Salazar, under advisement from Professor Banson in fall 2018. The site design followed Western's 2018 standards for branding and web accessibility and uses the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> component library for basic functionality. Site maintanence is now run by Dr Salazar, so some aspects of the current site may not reflect my work. </p>
        <a href="https://yorktown.cbe.wwu.edu/students/191/carrolr8/Bookstore/index.php" target="_blank">Watermark Books - online shopping simulation</a>
        <p>I created this site for my Fundamentals of Web Development course in winter 2019 using a design from Professor Chris Sandvig. For the courseâ€™s final project, I developed additional functionality, reconfigured the design styles, and created site graphics on <a href="canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a>. I have not been able to update the site to comply with new PHP and MySQL standards, so there are a few minor bugs in the functionality. </p>
        <a href="http://myweb.students.wwu.edu/~carrolr8/CS202/secure/bellingham-hotel/index.php" target="_blank">Bellingham Hotel - sample site</a>
        <p>I created this site for my Dynamic Web Pages course in fall 2018, using a design from Professor Justice Banson. The functional design includes JavaScript on the Home and Gallery pages to make dynamic images, as well as an active Contact page form.</p>
